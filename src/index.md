# Folk Tunes

This site is my pet project for capturing information about, notation for, and lyrics for the folk tunes I have learned or am trying to learn. I go to a session locally to practice, share, and learn more tunes.

# Welcome to your new Bridgetown website.

You can learn more about how to build and deploy your new website by reading the  [Bridgetown documentation](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs).

You can choose a [theme](https://github.com/topics/bridgetown-theme) or add some [plugins](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/plugins/) to get started quickly.

Be sure to check out the [Bridgetown Cards](https://bridgetown.cards) community site for helpful tips & tricks.

If you run into any issues or have additional questions, please join us in our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/4E6hktQGz4) or in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown/discussions).

_Have fun and **good luck**!_
